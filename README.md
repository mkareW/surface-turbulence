# surface-turbulence
R scripts for calculation of surface turbulent fluxes over snow/ice

mobulk3: R function to calculate surface turbulent fluxes (latent and sensible heat fluxes) using data from a meteorological station located above the ice. The function takes as entry:

#V windspeed in ms-1

#Ta air temperature in K

#RH air relative humidity in %

#p air barometric pressure in mbars

#Zv,Zt,Zrh : height of the measurements (V,T,RH) in m 

#Ts: temperature of the surface in K

#z0,z0t,z0q: surface roughness lengths in m
